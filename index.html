Prologue:
<br>
Elizabeth, see that? That's the horizon." 
<br>
"Where do you think the end of the horizon is?" 
<br>
<br>
I faintly think back to the time where I had freedom. A time when I wasn't bedridden. A time when I had life. 
<br>
It's such a shame. I'm now stuck between life and death. I can watch the lives of others, their exciting and free lives, but I'm not exactly dead either. 
<br>
I'm just stuck here. 
<br>
<br>
forever.

Chapter 1:
<br>
<br>
Sitting in the same bed that I’ve been in since yesterday, and the day before yesterday, and the day before that too, I silently gaze at the crystal fragments of light that passed through the frosted glass vase next to my bedside with flowers in it. Even the cheap vase of lilac flowers have more life in them than me. How envious. 
<br>
<br>
Just as I was about to reach my hand out to the lilacs, I heard the rare rattling sound of the sliding doors. 
<br>
<br>
“Elizabeth, is it?” A humble and deep voice muttered as the frantic flipping of the pages ruffled, almost like the sound of autumn leaves being swept up, a sound I haven’t heard in ages. His face was revealed after he walked past the temporary blue wall of curtains that could be pushed around. His face and demeanour certainly looked worthy of the title of “head doctor”.
<br>
<br>
“Yes,” I nodded in reply while my eyes followed him. I rested my hands on my body, and waited for the questions he was about to ask, “I’m Calla Elizabeth.”
<br>
<br>
“Calla Elizabeth… I see,” he looked away from his papers, seeming hesitant at the mention of my name, but eventually shrugging and continuing the flipping of his pages. Finally, he stopped at a page and held the clipboard of papers in his hand. 
<br>
<br>
“So, how are you feeling now? Any discomfort? Chest pains? Any aches? Any nausea?” 
<br>
<br>
The list seemed like it would keep going on and on unless I said something. 
<br>
<br>
“Nope. I feel fine.” I wasn’t lying. I’ve been feeling fine for the past few days, so I’m really not sure why they’ve been keeping me bedridden,“If anything, I want to be released as soon as possible.”
<br>
<br>
My eyes naturally fell towards the sky out the windows as I mentioned those few words, requesting nothing more than just freedom. Did it seem like such a bold, forbidden request? 
<br>
<br>
The head doctor stared at me, appearing shocked, after hearing my words. “If money is what you’re worrying about, the insurance will cover it.”
<br>
<br>
I stared right back at him. “I want to go back to school.”
<br>
<br>
He sighed, and looked at the papers resting in his hands before reluctantly looking back at me. My eyes were set, and my gaze was fixed on this point. Anyone could tell that I was certain. This was what I wanted. This was all I wanted. To escape from this jail cell of a room. To escape, and return being able to hear the sounds of the waves, shaking and rattling against the sand on a shore. Like the wind chimes rattling among a blow of the spring winds. Like the autumn leaves swept up by a punished student, making way for winter and a lesson to be learnt. Like a violent winter storm, hitting against a metal roof. 
<br>
<br>
All my bottled up feelings of wanting freedom must’ve reflected in my eyes, as the doctor took the pen from his top left pocket and signed against clipboard. 
<br>
<br>
“Leave by 10am tomorrow.”
